Post and post_parser_record (ppr) are classes that iterate through 
   and create objects to structure and parse .xml files downloaded 
   from Stack Exchange (https://archive.org/download/stackexchange).

Lab03.py is a collection of imports, function definitions and function calls 
   to satisfy the requirements for the third lab in a Natural Language Processing 
   course. Lab03.py is structured so that imports are at the beginning of the file, 
   followed by global variables that call the ppr class using the post_file_path, 
   function definitions, and finally function calls.

When using Lab03.py, make sure to change the post_file_path variable to 
   the path of the file you wish to analyze. The file “Law_Posts.xml” is 
   too large to upload to GitHub so it is not included.

All function calls that correlate with a single “Step” in the lab are 
   commented out. I suggest uncommenting and then running each mini block 
   of function calls one at a time as they can take multiple seconds 
   each to complete.
