Lab 2 - February 3, 2023
Aimee Haas, Sean Fletcher, SJ Franklin

Summary:

Program traverses through a defined directory path, the_directory_path,
and stores every text file's path that matches a regex in a list of file
paths. 

The second step set of functions goes through the list of text files and
extracts the dates, then reformats them into month/day/year.

The third step goes through the list of text files and extracts strings in a
word-number-word pattern, combines the results in a string, and then uses that
string to create a word cloud of the 20 most frequently used words.

A PDF of the word cloud analysis is also included, labeled as
"Lab2 - Step 3 Analysis"
