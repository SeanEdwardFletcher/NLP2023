In the lab_05.py file on line #293 there is the comment "# function calls".

Under this comment are sections of commented out code and function definitions. 
In order to run this code you will need to uncomment the sections of code
you want to run, and then run the file. These sections are commented out
becuase they make calls to ChatGPT's API and I was running out of alloted 
funds with which to do that.
