This is not my code, it is the code of one of my professors. Me and
a lab partner spent time changing the parameters of the model, and
this is the file we are submitting.

This is a sentiment classification LSTM model.

In order to run this file you need to have a file named "Tweets.csv". This
file needs to already be tagged with "negative", "neutral", or "positive" for
each tweet. 


parameters to change can be found on lines:
